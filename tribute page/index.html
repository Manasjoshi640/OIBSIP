<h2>A brief summary of lata's journey</h2>
<h3>pride of the nation no more</h3>
<p>India's Nightingale, singing legend Lata Mangeshkar passed away on Sunday morning. In a career spanning over seven decades, Mangeshkar delivered memorable hits that have left a mark on the Indian music industry.

<h3>Dignity Personified</h3>
<p>Lata Mangeshkar was born in 1929 in Indore. She was the eldest daughter of Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar, a Marathi musician and a theater actor. A lesser-known fact about the singing legend is that Mangeshkar’s family’s last name used to be Hardikar but her father changed it to Mangeshkar in order to identify with his family’s native town, Mangeshi,

<h3>The Beginning Of A New Chapter</h3>
<p>
At the age of five, Lata started working as an actress in her father’s musical plays. After he died of heart disease when she was 13, Master Vinayak of Navyug Chitrapat movie company took care of the kids. He helped kickstart Lata’s career as a singer and an actress.

<h3>Climbing The Ladder Of Success</h3>
<p>One of Lata Mangeshkar’s first major hits was the song ‘Aayega Aanewaala,’ from the movie ‘Mahal’ (1949). Lata's song "Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya" from ‘Mughal-e-Azam’ (1960), Hawaii theme song ‘Ajeeb Dastaan Hai Yeh’ from ‘Dil Apna Preet Parai’ (1960) won her critical acclaim.
